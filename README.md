# [r/dailyprogrammer challenge #232](https://redd.it/3l61vx)

This solution is written in [Wren](http://wren.io) at commit `f757c9efacfaa6ba3771b03b6e27d029e964f5af`.

Because Wren doesn't support file I/O (yet?), you need to build a file called `inputs.wren` which will contain the inputs. Run `python build_inputs.py inputs/16.txt` to build this file. You can run it on other files in `inputs/` for different inputs.

After that, just run `wren 232.wren`.
